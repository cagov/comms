<h2>Please test this work in progress</h2>

<p>It’s been a very busy, very productive six weeks for our team. (Even despite the holiday season!)

<p>As we’ve documented in our weekly “Done/doing” blogs, we’ve begun to build the proverbial plane, even as we’ve approaching cruising altitude.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Doing</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Finalizing product framework</li>
	<li>Continuing discovery and research on initial user needs</li>
	<li>Creating additional content types prototypes</li>
	<li>Adding new widgets to design pattern library</li>
	<li>Starting qualitative research around user needs</li>
</ul>
