<h2>Highlighted project needs</h2>

<h3>Agile Delivery Manager</h3>
<p>We’re looking for an experienced Agile delivery manager to join our team for up to a year to support ongoing development of the covid19.ca.gov site.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.alpha.ca.gov/">You can read more about the team building the COVID-19 response and their work on the Alpha CA.gov project on the blog.</a></p>
<p>As an Agile delivery manager you will be responsible for product delivery and for building and maintaining a motivated team, look after team health and set up an environment for successful delivery. You’ll be experienced in coaching teams and others in agile and lean techniques, and helping people adapt from traditional waterfall approaches to agile, iterative and user-centred ways of working.</p>
<p>This is not a typical Project Manager role - we’re looking for a good facilitator who can help the team become more self-organizing and continuously improve. Part of the role will involve making sure the team has an iterative plan to guide their work and that team members collaborate, communicate and focus on priorities. We’re looking for someone who can give the team a rhythm and momentum, remove blockers that impede delivery and manage risk.</p>
<p>Essential attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experienced at coaching modern agile and lean techniques</li>
  <li>Demonstrated ability to assist teams in breaking down problems into small units of working service</li>
  <li>Adept at navigating an organization to remove blockers that impede delivery (i.e. bureaucracy hacker)</li>
  <li>Experienced scrum master</li>
  <li>Demonstrates servant leadership style</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit your interest via <a href="https://state-of-california-agency.forms.fm/california-digital-were-hiring/forms/7721">this form</a> and check “Delivery Management” as your primary skill</p>
